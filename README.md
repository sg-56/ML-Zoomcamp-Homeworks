## About the Zoomcamp

This course is perfect for those who want to:
- Understand the **fundamentals of Machine Learning**.
- Learn to use the **main ML frameworks** and deployment tools.

The only requirement is prior **programming experience (1+ year)** and familiarity with the **command line**. You donâ€™t need any previous knowledge of machine learningâ€”weâ€™ll guide you from the very basics all the way to advanced topics.

## Who Is This For?

This course is for anyone who:
- Has programming experience (preferably 1+ years).
- Wants to dive into machine learning without prior knowledge.
- Is eager to learn both theory and practical ML deployment.

## Course Structure

The zoomcamp is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: ML Algorithms in Python

In this section, you'll get hands-on experience with:
- **Linear Regression**: The building block of ML.
- **Classification**: Techniques like Logistic Regression and SVM.
- **Decision Trees**: Understanding decision-making in ML.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Bagging, boosting, and Random Forests.
- **Neural Networks**: A beginnerâ€™s guide to deep learning.

By the end of Part 1, youâ€™ll be familiar with core algorithms implemented in Python using libraries like **Scikit-learn** and **NumPy**.

### Part 2: Deploying Models

Here, the focus shifts to real-world applications:
- **Model Deployment with Flask**: Building web APIs for ML models.
- **TensorFlow**: Deploying deep learning models.
- **Kubernetes**: Containerizing and scaling your models for production.

Youâ€™ll learn how to take your models beyond development and deploy them in ways that make them accessible and scalable.

## Tools & Frameworks

Throughout the zoomcamp, youâ€™ll work with a range of tools and frameworks:
- **Python**: Your main programming language.
- **NumPy** and **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For ML algorithms.
- **Flask**: To deploy models as APIs.
- **TensorFlow**: For deep learning models.
- **Kubernetes**: To scale and deploy models in production environments.
